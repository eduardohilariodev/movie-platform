## üìã About the Project

This project serves as a practical demonstration of modern frontend development techniques using the Vue 3 ecosystem. It simulates a common e-commerce flow‚Äîbrowsing items (movies), adding them to a cart, and proceeding through a multi-step checkout process.

The primary motivation was to build a visually appealing, highly responsive application that showcases proficiency in:

- **Component-Based Architecture:** Structuring a Vue application logically.
- **State Management:** Effectively handling application state with Pinia.
- **Asynchronous Operations:** Managing API calls and loading states smoothly.
- **UI/UX Best Practices:** Implementing features like infinite scrolling, skeleton loading, and form validation for a better user experience.
- **Modern Tooling:** Utilizing Vite, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS for an efficient development workflow.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

This project leverages a modern frontend stack:

- **Framework:** Vue 3 (Composition API, `<script setup>`)
- **Language:** TypeScript
- **Build Tool:** Vite
- **State Management:** Pinia (for managing movies, cart, form state) - *Chosen for its simplicity, type safety, and integration with Vue DevTools.*
- **Routing:** Vue Router - *Handles client-side navigation and guards.*
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS - *Utility-first CSS for rapid UI development and responsiveness.*
  - `clsx` & `tailwind-merge` for conditional class management.
- **Animations:**
  - `motion-v`: Simple declarative animations.
  - `animate.css`: Pre-built CSS animations.
- **Forms:**
  - VeeValidate: For declarative form validation.
  - Zod: For schema definition and validation, integrated with VeeValidate.
  - `maska`: Input masking for improved UX (e.g., credit card numbers).
- **Asynchronous Operations:** Native `fetch` API within Pinia actions.
- **Composables:**
  - VueUse (`useIntersectionObserver`, etc.)
  - Custom composables (e.g., `useCurrency`)
- **Code Quality:** ESLint & Prettier

## üèóÔ∏è Project Architecture

The project follows a standard component-based architecture, organized for clarity and maintainability:

```
src/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ components/      # UI Components (base, ui, features)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ composables/     # Reusable Vue Composition API functions
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ lib/             # External libraries or integrations
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ router/          # Vue Router configuration
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ stores/          # Pinia state management modules
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ styles/          # Global styles, Tailwind config
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ types/           # TypeScript type definitions
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ views/           # Page-level components mapped to routes
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ App.vue          # Root Vue component
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ main.ts          # Application entry point
```

Key architectural decisions:

- **Composition API:** Enables better logic reuse and organization compared to the Options API.
- **Pinia:** Preferred over Vuex for its simpler API, better TypeScript support, and modularity.
- **Utility-First CSS:** Tailwind CSS allows for rapid development and consistent styling without leaving the HTML/template.

## üöÄ Usage and Features

- **Movie Browsing:** Displays a grid of movies fetched from an API (e.g., TMDB).
- **Infinite Scrolling:** Automatically loads more movies as the user scrolls down, using `useIntersectionObserver` to trigger API calls for the next page.
- **Skeleton Loading:** Shows skeleton placeholders while movie data is being fetched, improving perceived performance.
- **Shopping Cart:**
  - Add/remove movies from the cart.
  - Cart state persists using Pinia and potentially local storage.
  - View cart details (items, total price).
- **Checkout Form:**
  - Multi-step form (e.g., Shipping, Payment).
  - Client-side validation using VeeValidate + Zod schemas.
  - Input masking for fields like credit card numbers.
- **Responsive Design:** Adapts seamlessly to various screen sizes using Tailwind CSS.
- **Animations:** Subtle UI animations enhance user interaction.

## üß© Challenges and Solutions

### Challenge 1: Implementing Smooth Infinite Scroll

- **Problem:** Efficiently displaying a potentially large list of movies fetched from an API without impacting initial page load or requiring pagination clicks, while providing clear loading feedback.
- **Solution:**
    1. Fetched the initial set of movies on component mount (`movieStore.fetchMovies()`).
    2. Used `@vueuse/core`'s `useIntersectionObserver` to monitor a target element near the bottom of the movie list.
    3. When the target became visible and data wasn't already loading (`!movieStore.loadingMore`), triggered the `fetchMovies` action again with the next page number.
    4. Managed distinct loading states (`isRecommendationsLoading` for initial load, `loadingMore` for subsequent fetches) to show appropriate feedback (skeleton vs. spinner) and prevent duplicate requests.
- **Outcome:** A seamless browsing experience where movies load progressively as the user scrolls, keeping the initial load fast and UI responsive.

### Challenge 2: Structuring State with Pinia

- **Problem:** Organizing application state (movies, cart, user preferences, form data) in a scalable, type-safe, and easily testable manner. Managing asynchronous data fetching and state mutations cleanly.
- **Solution:**
    1. Adopted Pinia as the central state management library due to its simplicity, excellent TypeScript support, and modular nature.
    2. Created separate stores for distinct domains (`movieStore`, `cartStore`, `checkoutFormStore`, etc.) located in `src/stores/`.
    3. Defined state properties, getters (computed state), and actions (methods for mutations and async operations) within each store using the Composition API syntax.
    4. Leveraged TypeScript interfaces/types (`src/types/`) to strongly type the state, getters, and action payloads/return values.
    5. Handled API interactions within Pinia actions, updating the store's state upon successful fetching or error handling.
- **Outcome:** Clear separation of concerns for state management, improved code organization and maintainability, enhanced type safety reducing potential runtime errors, and simplified component logic by centralizing state access and modifications.

### Challenge 3: Managing Exclusive UI States (e.g., Drawers)

- **Problem:** Ensuring that only one overlay or drawer component (like the shopping cart, filters, or a user menu) is active/visible at any given time to prevent UI clutter and maintain a focused user experience. Coordinating the open/close state across potentially unrelated components.
- **Solution:**
    1. Implemented a dedicated Pinia store (`uiStore`) or a custom composable (`useUIState`) to manage global UI state, including which drawer (if any) is currently open.
    2. Defined state properties in the store/composable (e.g., `activeDrawer: 'cart' | 'filters' | null`).
    3. Components responsible for opening a drawer would call an action/method (e.g., `uiStore.openDrawer('cart')`) which updates the `activeDrawer` state.
    4. Drawer components themselves would use this state (or a computed property based on it) to control their visibility (`v-if="uiStore.activeDrawer === 'cart'"`).
    5. Closing a drawer would involve setting `activeDrawer` back to `null`. Actions to open a drawer could implicitly close any currently open one.
- **Outcome:** Consistent and predictable UI behavior where only one drawer is displayed at a time. Centralized control simplifies state synchronization and avoids prop drilling or complex event emissions for managing visibility across the application.
